Mileage Prediction: Regression Analysis
This project focuses on predicting vehicle mileage using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models. The goal is to explore and compare the effectiveness of these algorithms in regression analysis for accurate mileage prediction.

Project Overview:
In this project, we use a dataset containing various features of vehicles (e.g., engine size, weight, fuel type) to predict their mileage. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key insights and correlations.
- Building and evaluating regression models.

Algorithms Used
1. Linear Regression:

A simple, interpretable model that fits a linear relationship between input features and the target variable (mileage).

2. Random Forest Regressor:

An ensemble-based algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle non-linear relationships.
